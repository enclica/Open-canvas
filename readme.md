# Open-canvas
Open canvas is a template perfect for getting ideas. This is from the excenote draw tool but simplifed for testing and screwing around.

Open canvas uses MDB and JQUERY for both js and styling all rights are reserved for those 2 libaries.


Open canvas is developed by Enclica software 2021.
